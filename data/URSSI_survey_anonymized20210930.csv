But here is what I do:

When interviewing potential recruits, it is possible that unaddressed bias might lead to an ethnically or sexually uniform monoculture. Therefore, we take care to involve lab members of minority ethnicity in interviews and also insure that the male:female ratio of interview teams is balanced.

Additionally, the same interview questions are asked of all candidates (in the general sense, we of course may follow up on a given candidate's experience with specific questions) and the interview process is transparent to the lab primary investigators (and to University investigators as well, though no one has ever done an audit of our interview practices to my knowledge).

Prevailing cultural trends can sometimes lead to careless behavior which causes discord along known fault lines (on the basis or race or ethnicity, on the basis of sex or gender, on the basis of creed or religion, etc). In the lab, we try to create a welcoming and professional workplace which recognizes that our field is staffed by workers from all walks of life, including many ethnic backgrounds, different sexual orientations, different ages, and so on. As such, conversation should be respectful, open-minded, and conducted with the realization that we are all trying to understand the underlying biology.","I don't think so. Our projects simply aren't big enough to justify the expense at the moment. Most of the work I do involves an analyst (me) working with a single post-doctoral fellow or graduate student, so it doesn't really match the development team model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They only collect overheads and pester scientists with irrelevant  online courses (ethics, grant administration, managing COI, sexual harrassement, etc).  All what we get is faculty salary and space. 

The funding agencies do not provide sufficient support for software. Most grants fund scientific research and only a small part of this support actually contributes to code writing by students and postdocs. THERE IS NO SUPPORT for code maintenance, testing, documentation, etc. The only way to support these parts of software development cycle is via license income, the strategy that many teams follow -- see J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 6, 2751 (2015). However, this survival strategy is now threatened by the mindless pushing of open-source requirements by the funding agencies. 

When funding agencies do give money for software development, they choose to do so in the least effective for the community way -- funding giant consortia that come with a huge bureaucratic burden and are not at all effective in creative robust and effective software infrastructure. These funding models do not promote the best practices of funding that should be grounded in intellectual merit, individual track record, and documented impact on science. They do not take into account track record of the people.  As I observed many times, it is not the  best teams with solid track record that get software grants, it is those that are most effective in making grand unsupported claims. There are a number of terribly inefficient projects that sucked in huge amount of money because they are ""open-source"". NWChem is a primary (but not the only) example of such politically motivated funding. 

If we want to remain competitive in the scientific domains that heavily rely on software and computer modeling, the funding practices should be completely revised. We should go back and fund the project based on their intellectual merit and impact on science  and not on whether or not they use the right amount of buzzwords. The only way to insure that decisions are sound and that the money are used effectively is to fund individuals and small teams.

Outside of the team is another matter -- the field as a whole still suffers from stereotypes and biases.  One most prominent challenge is that women receive less outside recognition (awards, invited talks, reputation) for equal amount of work. I experienced it myself many times -- competing projects lead by males have garnered more visibility than mine. ","Not systematically.
